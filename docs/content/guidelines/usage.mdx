# Octicons usage guidelines

Octicons are a set of icons that are custom to GitHub. When using an octicon keep in mind that an icon should be use for _emphasis_ of the context it supports. 

Remember: Not everything needs an icon. It is recommended to consider a text label before adding an icon. Adding an octicon should be intentional. 

## Sizing
Octicons are available at 16px and 24px frame sizes. While they can be resized we recommend that octicons to be used at their original sizes to maintain consistency in stroke width.

## Spacing
When used in groups, octicons should have a minimum of 4px space between each icon.

## Octicons custom to `git`
The following should only be used for their specific meanings:

- Commits - The commit icon is represented as a circle on a line. This is to symbolize a point (the circle) along the version history timeline in which changes were made. This icon is to be used in views to represent individual or groups of commits. These views include the timeline and the Commits tab in pull requests.
- Issues - The issue icon is represented as a circle with an ! mark. The base issue icon is extended through slight modifications to communicate different states of an issue: a checkmark for a closed issue and combining the sync icon with an ! for reopening an issue. These three symbols are to be used exclusively with issues. 
- Pull requests - The pull request icon is represented as a commit dot attached with an arrow being inserted into the history timeline (two dots connected by a line).
- Repos - A repository in GitHub is represented as a closed book and is explicitly named as `repo`. Octicons does contain a `book` icon which displays an open book symbol that is used for wikis, READMEs, and other use cases where we provide a collection of information to a viewer (user?).
